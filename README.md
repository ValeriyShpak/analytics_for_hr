# analytics_for_hr
Main libraries: psycopg2, sqlalchemy, pandas. In this repository I have analyzed data about labor relations in some company, 
have hypothesized and have prepared number of recommendations for HR-department.
For example I have found out, that efficiency and retiring of worker depens on manager and I have determined the best managers 
according to these indicators. Besides I have found out, that efficiency of employee and cost-effectiveness of employee search
depends on employee source. And I have determined the best sources.
